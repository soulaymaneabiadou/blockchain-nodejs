# Blockchain
A blockchain built with Node JS and a server to expose an API using Express JS, along side a Redis Pub/Sub implementation to setup peers.
It includes all of the features of a blockchain, including proof of work, mining and more.
But not recommended for any production setup, as the p2p communication requires the main node to be up all time.
